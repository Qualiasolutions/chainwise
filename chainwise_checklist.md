## Core Product Features

### AI Whale Copy Signals
- [ ] **What it does**: Tracks what specific whale wallets are buying/selling and delivers them as actionable signals
- [ ] **Why it's premium**: Users can "copy trade" smart money without spending hours on-chain analysis
- [ ] **Example**: "Whale 0x123 just bought 2,000 ETH on Uniswap + potential bullish signal"
- [ ] **Pricing**: $19.99/month

### Altcoin Early Detector
- [ ] **What it does**: Detects small-cap coins before they get listed on major exchanges (Binance, Coinbase)
- [ ] **Why it's premium**: Being early on listings can generate huge returns (x10-x100)
- [ ] **Example**: "Token XYZ shows strong social buzz + dev activity = likely Binance listing soon"
- [ ] **Pricing**: $24.99/month

### ChainWise Signals Pack
- [ ] **What it does**: Provides 2-3 daily AI-generated trading setups (long/short opportunities)
- [ ] **Why it's premium**: Traders don't just want analysis, they want actionable signals they can trade instantly
- [ ] **Example**: "AI Signal: Long ETH at $2,950 → Target $3,200 → Risk: -4%"
- [ ] **Pricing**: $29.99/month

## AI Smart DCA & Exit Planner

### What is DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)
- [ ] Investment strategy where you invest fixed amount of money at regular intervals
- [ ] Goal: "smooth out" your entry price over time and reduce risk of buying everything at wrong moment
- [ ] Example Implementation:
  - [ ] You want to invest $1,000 in Bitcoin
  - [ ] Instead of putting all in today, you invest:
    - [ ] $100 every week for 10 weeks
  - [ ] Result:
    - [ ] Sometimes you buy at higher price
    - [ ] Sometimes at lower price
    - [ ] Your average entry cost becomes more stable → less risk

### Exit Planner Features
- [ ] Just like DCA is for entering the market, Exit Planner is for selling
- [ ] The AI suggests:
  - [ ] "Sell 10% of your position at $50,000"
  - [ ] "Sell another 20% at $60,000"
- [ ] This way, you secure profits step by step instead of trying to guess the exact top

### AI Smart DCA & Exit Planner Combined
- [ ] Recommends when & how much to buy incrementally (smart DCA strategy)
- [ ] Build personalized selling plan based on goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions
- [ ] Result: users don't need to be pro traders - AI gives them structured plan for both entering and exiting the market

## AI Smart Portfolio Allocator/Personal AI Portfolio Manager

### What It Does
- [ ] The AI Smart Portfolio Allocator scans user's crypto portfolio and provides clear percentage-based recommendations on how to optimize their holdings
- [ ] Key Features:
  - [ ] Buy coins with strong bullish momentum
  - [ ] Hold coins with stable or neutral outlook
  - [ ] Sell coins with weak signals or high risk
- [ ] Example recommendation:
  - [ ] Allocate 70% BTC (strong bullish trend)
  - [ ] Hold 20% ETH (neutral sentiment, long-term hold)
  - [ ] Sell 10% ADA (weak momentum, better opportunities elsewhere)

### How It Works
1. [ ] Portfolio Scan → Reads user's current allocations
2. [ ] Market & Sentiment Analysis → AI reviews trends, whale flows, and risk signals
3. [ ] Recommendation → Suggests percentage adjustments (buy/hold/sell)
4. [ ] User Control → The user decides whether to follow the AI's advice

### Why It's Premium (Add-on)
- [ ] Goes beyond simple insights → personalized portfolio strategy
- [ ] Saves users hours of research and helps them avoid bad allocation mistakes
- [ ] Because of high value, offered as Add-on via credits or bundles with Elite plan

### Pricing Options
- [ ] One-time AI Allocation Report → $9.99 (or 20 credits)
- [ ] Monthly Add-on (Auto-Rebalancing Reports) → $19.99/month

### Benefits for Users
- [ ] No need to guess allocation percentages
- [ ] Dynamic AI-based strategy that adapts to the market
- [ ] Helps maximize returns while controlling risk

## Reports System

### AI Pro Report (Weekly)
- [ ] **What it is**: A weekly report tailored for Pro users
- [ ] **Focus**: Practical insights and easy-to-digest content
- [ ] **What it includes**:
  - [ ] Top 3 coins of the week (performance + risk snapshot)
  - [ ] Market overview (what's moving, main narratives)
  - [ ] Simple portfolio tip (e.g., "diversify with 10% stablecoins")
  - [ ] Alerts recap (e.g., "BTC broke resistance at $XX")
- [ ] **Purpose**:
  - [ ] Keep Pro users engaged
  - [ ] Feels like "personal guidance" without being overwhelming
  - [ ] Makes Pro worth the $12.99/month
- [ ] **Users feel**: "I'm getting weekly intelligence that makes me smarter than the average trader"

### Elite Deep AI Report (Monthly)
- [ ] **What it is**: A monthly premium report exclusive for Elite users
- [ ] **Focus**: Much deeper and more exclusive than Pro version
- [ ] **What it includes**:
  - [ ] Full trend & narrative detection (from X, Reddit, TikTok)
  - [ ] Advanced technical & on-chain analysis (2-3 coins/sectors)
  - [ ] Whale wallet movements (key highlights)
  - [ ] Stress-test scenario (e.g., "What if BTC drops 20% tomorrow?")
  - [ ] Sentiment heatmap (market-wide bullish/bearish signals)
  - [ ] Elite-only recommendations ("under-the-radar coins to watch")
- [ ] **Purpose**:
  - [ ] Makes Elite users feel VIP & exclusive
  - [ ] Justifies the higher price ($24.99/month)
  - [ ] Creates prestige: "I'm part of an inner circle"
- [ ] **Users feel**: "I'm getting deep insights nobody else has access to"

### Sample Elite Deep AI Report (Monthly)
*Included in Elite plan - heavy, exclusive, VIP-level analysis*

#### March 2025 - Elite Report
- [ ] **Market Narratives Detected** (via X, Reddit, TikTok):
  1. [ ] AI tokens (FET, AGIX, RNDR) trending again (+280% mentions)
  2. [ ] RWA (Real World Assets) narrative growing - top mentions: ONDO, POLYX
  3. [ ] Bitcoin halving hype → "$100k" trend resurging

- [ ] **On-Chain & Technical Analysis**:
  - [ ] BTC: Whale wallets accumulating 50k+ BTC in February. Support at $59k, resistance $67k. Stress-test scenario: If BTC drops -20%, ETH likely follows with -25%
  - [ ] ETH: Daily active addresses up +12%. Long-term with ETH ETF narrative
  - [ ] SOL: On-chain activity spiked +30% due to DeFi flows. Risk: network congestion

- [ ] **Whale Activity**:
  - [ ] $220M BTC moved off exchanges → bullish
  - [ ] ETH whales stacking, stablecoin inflows at 3-month high

- [ ] **Sentiment Heatmap**:
  - [ ] Market sentiment = Bullish (65%), but caution flagged in meme coins
  - [ ] AI tokens show strongest bullish momentum

- [ ] **Elite Recommendations**:
  - [ ] Short-term: Watch ARB & OP (Layer 2 narratives)
  - [ ] Mid-term: Accumulate ETH before halving hype
  - [ ] Long-term: Position in AI + RWA tokens before Q2

- [ ] **Takeaway**: Elite members get a full VIP snapshot of trends, whale moves, and AI-driven recommendations
- [ ] *Information not available to the average trader*

### Difference Between Reports
- [ ] **Pro Report** = Weekly, quick & practical → keeps retail users engaged
- [ ] **Elite Report** = Monthly, deep dive & exclusive → creates prestige → real trader's edge
- [ ] Both can be **sold as Add-ons** if users want more

## Monetization Strategy

### Pro Report
- [ ] 1 included per week for Pro users
- [ ] Extra reports → Add-on ($4.99/month or 5 credits each)

### Elite Deep Report
- [ ] 1 included per month for Elite users
- [ ] Extra reports → Add-on ($9.99/report or 10 credits)

- [ ] Note: Even Pro & Elite users will pay more if they want extra reports

### Why This Matters
- [ ] **For users**: Feels like premium guidance, not just raw data
- [ ] **For us**: Reports are content we can repurpose (newsletters, social teasers, marketing)
- [ ] **For revenue**: Reports create **upsell opportunities** (extra reports via credits)

## Credits System

### What are Credits?
- [ ] Credits are the internal currency of ChainWise
- [ ] Users spend credits every time they use a premium/heavy AI feature (e.g. Whale Tracker, Narrative Deep Scans, Deep Dive Reports)
- [ ] Each subscription plan (Free/Pro/Elite) includes some credits per month
- [ ] When users run out → they buy extra credits packs
- [ ] This ensures revenue from every user, even Free ones

### Credits per Plan
- [ ] **Free** → 3 credits/month (only to taste premium)
- [ ] **Pro** → 50 credits/month
- [ ] **Elite** → 200 credits/month

### What Costs Credits?
*Not the simple features (like coin comparisons or price checks). Credits are for premium, high-value actions:*
- [ ] Whale Wallet Tracker → 5 credits/report
- [ ] Narrative & Trend Deep Scans → 10 credits/scan
- [ ] Deep Dive AI Reports → 10 credits/report
- [ ] Advanced Scam & Fraud Checks → 5 credits/scan
- [ ] AI Stress Tests → 5 credits/run
- [ ] Smart DCA & Exit Plans → 5 credits/plan
- [ ] NFT/DeFi Analyzers → 5 credits/scan
- [ ] Trading Playbook Simulations → 5-10 credits/run

### Extra Credits Packs (Revenue)
*Users can always buy more credits:*
- [ ] 50 credits → $4.99
- [ ] 200 credits → $14.99
- [ ] 500 credits → $29.99
- [ ] This is extra money on top of subscriptions

### Why Credits are Key
1. [ ] **Double monetization** → Subscriptions + Credits
2. [ ] **Free users still generate revenue** (they can buy credits without upgrading)
3. [ ] **Pro & Elite users never feel limited** (they can always pay for more)
4. [ ] **Power users = super customers** → they spend 2x-3x the base subscription

- [ ] This system ensures ChainWise is not just a subscription SaaS, but a **scalable revenue machine**

## Extra Add-ons Features

### Available Add-ons
- [ ] **Extra Elite Reports** → $9.99/report or 10 credits

## Additional Features & Add-ons

### Pump & Dump Radar
- [ ] e.g Token XYZ unsual 500% volume spike in 10 minutes - Potential Pump&Dump
- [ ] Portfolio Risk Insurance Simulator (if BTC drops -40%, your portfolio would lose -55%)

- [ ] Token Hype Score (e.g. Token XYZ → Hype Score 92/100) - Calculates a hype score (0-100) for tokens based on social mentions, trading volume and developer activity

- [ ] AI Token Burn & Supply Tracker (e.g.BNB burned $450M last Quarter, Supply drop 2%)

## Why ChainWise Stands Out

1. [ ] **Not just another AI bot**
   - [ ] Persona modes (Buddy, Professor, Trader)
   - [ ] Advanced risk & sentiment tools no one else has

2. [ ] **Premium positioning**
   - [ ] We're not a "cheap tool" → We are the Bloomberg + ChatGPT of crypto
   - [ ] Free = teaser, Pro = mass adoption, Elite = prestige

3. [ ] **Dual monetization**
   - [ ] Subscriptions = recurring revenue
   - [ ] Add-ons & credits = variable revenue
   - [ ] ARPU can be 2x-3x higher than competitors

4. [ ] **Roadmap-driven growth**
   - [ ] We don't give everything at launch
   - [ ] Every new phase adds excitement → keeps users subscribed

## Conclusion

ChainWise is:
- [ ] The **smartest crypto AI** (personas + premium analysis)
- [ ] The **most premium** (Elite = prestige, VIP experience)
- [ ] The **most profitable model** (subscriptions + Add-ons)
- [ ] A **roadmap-first product** → continuous growth and retention

We're building not just a platform, but the **#1 premium AI brand in crypto**.
