# ChainWise Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable sophisticated retail crypto investors to access institutional-grade portfolio analytics through an intuitive, purple-themed interface
- Provide AI-powered guidance through three distinct personas (Buddy, Professor, Trader) tailored to user experience levels
- Create a sustainable SaaS business with $2M ARR within 18 months through tiered subscription model
- Bridge the gap between basic crypto tracking apps and complex institutional platforms
- Deliver real-time market intelligence with advanced risk assessment capabilities (VaR, Sharpe Ratio, Beta, correlation analysis)
- Establish mobile-first responsive platform that scales from individual traders to small crypto funds

### Background Context

The cryptocurrency investment landscape suffers from a critical tool gap where retail traders must choose between overly simplistic apps or prohibitively complex institutional platforms. ChainWise addresses this by providing sophisticated analytics traditionally reserved for institutions through an accessible, AI-guided interface.

Our solution leverages the growing sophistication of crypto investors who understand basic concepts but lack access to professional-grade risk assessment, portfolio attribution, and market intelligence tools. By combining real-time data integration with AI personas that adapt to user experience levels, we create a platform that grows with the user while maintaining institutional-quality analytics.
