# BMad Documentation Sharding Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the BMad v4 sharding task completed for ChainWise, breaking down the comprehensive PRD and Architecture documents into development-ready, manageable pieces for the SM → Dev → QA workflow.

## What Was Sharded

### 1. PRD Document → Epic Files (`docs/prd/`)

The original `docs/prd.md` has been decomposed into epic-specific files focusing on the brownfield enhancement requirements:

| Epic File | Content | Development Priority |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| **epic-1-foundation-authentication.md** | Project setup, Supabase integration, authentication system | **CRITICAL** - Foundation for all other work |
| **epic-2-portfolio-management.md** | Core portfolio CRUD, holdings management, real-time prices | **HIGH** - Core platform functionality |
| **epic-8-missing-core-pages.md** | Market Analysis, Trading, Portfolio, Profile, Settings pages | **HIGH** - Complete platform feature set |
| **epic-9-backend-integration.md** | Supabase backend, OpenAI integration, Stripe payments | **CRITICAL** - Transform demo to production |
| **epic-10-enhanced-user-experience.md** | Dark theme, error handling, mobile optimization, PWA | **MEDIUM** - Polish and optimization |

### 2. Architecture Document → Component Files (`docs/architecture/`)

The original `docs/architecture.md` has been broken down into focused technical specifications:

| Architecture File | Content | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|---------|
| **brownfield-integration-strategy.md** | Specific guidance for integrating backend services into existing frontend | **Integration Roadmap** |
| **tech-stack.md** | Complete technology selection with rationale and configuration | **Technical Foundation** |
| **database-schema.md** | Complete PostgreSQL schema with relationships and security | **Data Architecture** |
| **api-specification.md** | REST API endpoints with examples and validation rules | **Backend Development** |
| **frontend-architecture.md** | React components, state management, routing patterns | **Frontend Development** |

## How to Use for Development

### For Scrum Masters (SM)

#### Epic Planning
1. **Start with Epic Priority**: Focus on Epic 1 (Foundation) and Epic 9 (Backend Integration) first
2. **Use Epic Files for Story Creation**: Each epic file contains detailed user stories ready for refinement
3. **Reference Architecture Files**: Use architecture documents for technical story details and acceptance criteria

#### Story Creation Process
```
1. Read Epic File → Understand business goals and user stories
2. Reference Architecture → Add technical implementation details
3. Create Development Stories → Break down user stories into dev tasks
4. Add QA Criteria → Use acceptance criteria from epic files
```

#### Recommended Epic Sequence
```
Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication (Week 1-2)
  ↓
Epic 9: Backend Integration (Week 3-4)
  ↓
Epic 8: Missing Core Pages (Week 5-6)
  ↓
Epic 2: Portfolio Management (Week 7-8)
  ↓
Epic 10: Enhanced UX (Week 9-10)
```

### For Developers (Dev)

#### Getting Started
1. **Read `brownfield-integration-strategy.md`** first - Critical for understanding how to enhance existing code
2. **Reference `tech-stack.md`** for technology decisions and configuration
3. **Use `database-schema.md`** for all database work
4. **Follow `api-specification.md`** for backend development
5. **Reference `frontend-architecture.md`** for React component patterns

#### Development Workflow
```
Epic File → Understand Requirements
  ↓
Architecture Files → Technical Implementation
  ↓
Code Implementation → Following established patterns
  ↓
Testing → Using acceptance criteria from epics
```

#### Key Principles from Architecture
- **Preserve Excellence**: Don't break existing UI/UX quality
- **Follow Patterns**: Use established component and code structures
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Add features progressively with feature flags
- **Type Safety**: Maintain TypeScript throughout

### For QA Engineers

#### Test Planning
1. **Use Epic Acceptance Criteria**: Each epic file contains detailed acceptance criteria for testing
2. **Reference API Specification**: Use for API testing and validation
3. **Check Integration Strategy**: Understand brownfield constraints for testing approach

#### Testing Focus Areas by Epic
- **Epic 1**: Authentication flows, database connectivity, design system consistency
- **Epic 9**: Backend integration, real data flows, payment processing
- **Epic 8**: New page functionality, responsive design, cross-browser compatibility
- **Epic 2**: Portfolio management, real-time updates, data accuracy
- **Epic 10**: Performance, accessibility, mobile experience, error handling

## Development Team Handoff

### Immediate Next Steps

#### Week 1-2: Foundation Setup
**Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication**
- Set up Supabase project and database schema
- Implement authentication with existing UI
- Establish development environment and CI/CD

**Required Reading:**
- `epic-1-foundation-authentication.md` (complete epic)
- `brownfield-integration-strategy.md` (integration approach)
- `database-schema.md` (schema implementation)

#### Week 3-4: Backend Integration
**Epic 9: Backend Integration & Infrastructure**
- Replace mock data with Supabase queries
- Integrate OpenAI for real AI responses
- Set up Stripe payment processing

**Required Reading:**
- `epic-9-backend-integration.md` (complete epic)
- `api-specification.md` (endpoint development)
- `tech-stack.md` (technology configuration)

### Code Quality Guidelines

#### From Architecture Documents
1. **Type Sharing**: Use shared types from `@/types`
2. **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error response format
3. **Authentication**: Always verify session in API routes
4. **UI Components**: Build on shadcn/ui with purple theme
5. **Performance**: Maintain < 2s page load times

### Success Metrics

#### Technical Metrics
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Maintain 95+ Lighthouse scores
- ✅ All tests passing after each epic
- ✅ Type safety preserved throughout

#### Business Metrics
- ✅ Seamless user experience during development
- ✅ Feature functionality preserved and enhanced
- ✅ Professional UI/UX quality maintained
