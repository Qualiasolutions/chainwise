## User Stories

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Design System

As a developer,
I want to set up the Next.js 14 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components,
so that we have a solid foundation with a purple-themed glassmorphism design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 14 project initialized with TypeScript configuration
2. Tailwind CSS configured with custom purple color palette and glassmorphism utilities
3. shadcn/ui components installed and configured with purple theme overrides
4. Basic layout component with purple gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism effects
5. Responsive design system tested across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
6. Landing page implemented with hero section showcasing purple-themed design
7. Basic navigation component with conditional rendering support

### Story 1.2: Supabase Integration and Database Schema

As a developer,
I want to integrate Supabase with proper database schema and type definitions,
so that we have secure, scalable backend infrastructure for user data and portfolio management.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Supabase project configured with PostgreSQL database
2. Database schema created for users, portfolios, holdings, subscriptions, and chat sessions
3. Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented for data isolation
4. TypeScript types generated from database schema
5. Supabase client configured for both browser and server-side usage
6. Database migrations and seeding scripts created
7. Health check endpoint confirms database connectivity

### Story 1.3: User Authentication System

As a user,
I want to create an account and sign in securely,
so that I can access personalized portfolio management features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. User registration with email/password through Supabase Auth
2. Google OAuth integration for social login
3. Email verification flow for new accounts
4. Password reset functionality with secure token handling
5. User session management with automatic token refresh
6. Protected routes that redirect to login when not authenticated
7. User profile page showing basic account information
8. Secure logout functionality clearing all session data

### Story 1.4: Basic User Dashboard

As an authenticated user,
I want to see a personalized dashboard when I log in,
so that I can navigate to key platform features and see my account status.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard layout with purple-themed sidebar navigation
2. Welcome message displaying user's name and subscription tier
3. Quick stats cards showing portfolio count and AI credits remaining
4. Navigation menu with links to main platform sections
5. Mobile-responsive sidebar that collapses appropriately
6. Loading states and error handling for dashboard data
7. Conditional navigation based on subscription tier access

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- Users table (managed by Supabase Auth)
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  subscription_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'free' CHECK (subscription_tier IN ('free', 'pro', 'elite')),
  credits_balance INTEGER DEFAULT 3,
  last_credit_refresh TIMESTAMPTZ,
  total_points INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Initial RLS policies
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own data" ON users
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

### Design System Color Palette
```css
:root {
  /* Primary purple colors */
  --primary-600: #6B46C1;
  --primary-700: #7C3AED;

  /* Glassmorphism utilities */
  .glassmorphism {
    backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
    border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  }
}
```

### Next Steps After Epic Completion
