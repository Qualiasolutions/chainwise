# CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring Guide

## 🚀 Your Pipeline is Now Running!

The GitHub Actions workflow has been triggered by the latest push to `main`.

## 📊 Monitor Your Deployment

### Check GitHub Actions
**URL**: https://github.com/Qualiasolutions/chainwise/actions

You should see a new workflow run starting. It will execute these jobs:

#### 1. Lint & Type Check (1-2 minutes)
- ✅ ESLint validation
- ✅ TypeScript type checking
- ⚠️ Continues even if errors (per build config)

#### 2. Test Suite (1-2 minutes)
- ✅ Run all 21 tests
- ✅ Generate coverage report
- ✅ Upload to Codecov (optional)

#### 3. Build (2-3 minutes)
- ✅ Next.js production build
- ✅ Turbopack compilation
- ✅ 77 routes optimized
- ✅ Upload build artifacts

#### 4. Security Scan (1-2 minutes)
- ✅ npm audit
- ⚠️ Snyk scan (if token configured)

#### 5. Database Validation (< 1 minute)
- ✅ Check migration files
- ✅ Validate SQL syntax

#### 6. Deploy to Production (2-4 minutes)
- ✅ Deploy to Vercel
- ✅ Generate deployment URL
- ✅ Link to production domain

#### 7. Health Check (< 1 minute)
- ✅ Wait for deployment
- ✅ Call /api/health endpoint
- ✅ Verify application is running

---

## ✅ Expected Results

### Successful Workflow
If all goes well, you'll see:
- ✅ All jobs green/passing
- ✅ Deployment URL in workflow logs
- ✅ Application live at production URL
- ✅ Health check returns 200 OK

### Timeline
- **Total Duration**: ~8-12 minutes
- **First Deployment**: May take longer (cold start)
- **Subsequent Deployments**: Faster (cached)

---

## 🔍 Check Deployment Status

### Vercel Dashboard
**URL**: https://vercel.com/qualiasolutions-glluztech/chainwise

You should see:
- 🟢 New deployment in progress
- 📊 Build logs streaming
- 🌐 Preview URL generated
- ✅ Deployment completes successfully

### Your Live Application
Once deployed, your app will be live at:
- **Production**: https://chainwise.tech (or your configured domain)
- **Vercel URL**: https://chainwise-*.vercel.app

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Workflow Fails

#### Check Logs
1. Go to: https://github.com/Qualiasolutions/chainwise/actions
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Click on the failed job
4. Expand the step that failed
5. Read error messages

#### Common Issues

**1. Build Fails**
- Check if all environment variables are set
- Verify Supabase credentials are correct
- Check for TypeScript errors (though ignored in build)

**2. Deployment Fails**
- Verify Vercel token is valid
- Check Vercel project settings
- Ensure all secrets are correctly configured

**3. Health Check Fails**
- Application may need more time to start
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Verify /api/health endpoint works

**4. Tests Fail**
- Check test output in GitHub Actions
- Run tests locally: `npm run test:run`
- Fix failing tests and push again

### Get Help
- **GitHub Actions Logs**: Full error details
- **Vercel Logs**: Runtime errors and build issues
- **Local Testing**: `npm run build` to test locally
