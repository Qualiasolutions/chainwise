### Development Workflow
When working on this codebase:
1. Always run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Use `npm run lint` to check code quality before committing
3. Check browser console for runtime errors (build-time errors are ignored)
4. Supabase database is fully configured and production-ready
5. All UI components use shadcn/ui - check existing components before creating new ones

## Important Notes

The platform is production-ready with complete subscription system, animated pricing, and comprehensive settings management. Features include WebGL animations, 3D interactive globe, orbital timeline, and full user account management with Supabase MCP integration.

## important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
